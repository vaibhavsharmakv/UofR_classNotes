Security 

client side 
---------> 
The regularity check on size of file so someone cant add more html tags then allowed

SQL Injections
---------->
 make sure the data is not tampered with before you use it from GET and POST 
Use post and get can changed in url

mysqli_real_escape_String($_POST[$userEmail]);

HTMLspeacialChars()- wraps the variable around html tags incase attacker adds his own java script

dont use session variable with GET -
