Final Exam Review 
	- concept of modeling and simulation 
		- model -> A simplified representation of the system 
				- abstract representation of a system 
		- simulation -> A simplified representation of a process
	- Dependent and Independent variable 
		- example 
			f(x) = x^2 +1
			Dependent = f(x) (you cant manipulate it )
			Independent = x (the one you manipulate)
		- One way to check if the model is correct 
			- we can add some sort of indepent variables 
			- and see what sort of affect it has 
	- Analystic and Numeric 
		- Analystic - direct - exact - the solution we get after analysis 
			- direct solution derived from a model/system
				at time t = 4 , this is the state and so on 
		- Numeric - aproximate solution - end result of some sort of process
			- aproximate solution - resultant of a process
		- 
	- Stoppping behaviour
