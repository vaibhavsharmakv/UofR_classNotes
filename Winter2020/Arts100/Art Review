Art Review 
Rules:
--------------------------
- Italicize the title
- do not captalize it if artist didnt

- first time you mention artist name, write his full name

Describe 
-------------------------
- Can also start with your own experience 

Your first paragraph or two should adequately answer who/what/when/where

who  
-write about the artist 
-his style of work 
- what he is famous for 

What 
- write about the art
- what he made 
- small details on how it looks

when 
- when it was made and exhibited 
- how long it took to make it 

where 
- art gallery and where on the art gallery
-  garden/meadow 
- creak/river
- regina 

Observere 
--------------------------
You should describe the formal qualities of the artwork, so that someone who has not seen it can imagine it.

- describe the art in as much detail as possible from your POV
- write about what the art is like 
- how to it feels to watch it 
- your physical and emotional reaction

Interpret
-----------------------------
Sometimes this is woven into description. What do the choices of colour, line, form, scale, material, space mean?

- This does not need to be in a specific paragraph 
- Interpret the meaning of why artist choose certain thing 
- explain what it could mean and what it possibly menas 
- explain what it means to someone who doesnt understand art
