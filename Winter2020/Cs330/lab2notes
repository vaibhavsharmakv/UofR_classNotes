Lab 2 -------------------------------------------------------
make check - to produce output, compile and run 
make clean - recursively deletes output files


Write a Makefile for these files with the following specifications:
	Use gcc instead of g++
		- done
	Provide the options to debug the program later.
		- (--ggdb)
	Include at least one variable in your Makefile.
		- any variable 
	Add a clean target that will remove the executable, any core files, and any .o files
		-> rm -f *.o demo

GDB
	break linenumber -> to enter a break point on a line
	list -> to show next 10 lines 
	run -> to get to first breakpooint

malloc on line 15

Lab 3 -------------------------------------------------------
try sticking to using strncpy(cString, cString2, 100); 

in compare c function 
- if both are identical then that means there is no difference 
-  ! in front of the function will make it return positive 

there will be times where its asking for char*, when we see it -> translate it into looking at it as a character array
char* is basicually ab array of characters making it a string 

	- strncpy will help here to convert it into c string to eliminate the compiler error that it is expecting c string 

strdup will also have a free !!

token returned from strtok ois only an adress of the first character
	- it also add null terminiator in places of deliminator

Dynamnic arrays of C strings -> very close to what we need to do in the exersice 

strdup - 2 steps 
	- step 1 -> allocate memory for the strinf 
	- step 2 ->  then it copy the string into that allocation and then it returns the starting adress of the that c string 
	- !!! must send in a C string 

the basic idea with the example in the class is 
	- str dup makes c string in form of array and the adreess is saved in an array of 3 

also add the free for stdup

for the assignment ----
	- Store the answer to the following questions as comments at the beginning of main.cpp:
What is Dr. Hilderman's code tokenizing based on (ie. what delimeter(s) separate(s) his words)?
	- spaces

What are two reasons why his tokens are strings instead of c strings
	- readability 
	- dynamic size
