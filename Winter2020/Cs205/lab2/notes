Challenges- 
There were multiple challenges as I never used Illustartor before. One of the buggest challenge was to understand the layout of arboard and all the tools. There are so many tools and to keep a track of evertthing while learning can get overwhelming. Secondly, it is not easy to get ahold of how adobe coloring tools work by yourself. I used adobe official documentation/tutorials to get familiar with coloring and illustrator layout.

Comments - I like this SEALS logo as this logo represents teamwork and power. The 4 King structures show each mean in SEALS team and the red font represent how dangerous they are for the enemy. The red stars in the background represnts their wins against insurgence everytime. 
I would further like to make this logo 3d with enhanced gun details
