Milestone 2: Project Design (Wednesday Oct 17): 10%
There are three general goals for the design milestone:
(1) to identify the key tasks that the user will need to perform in the context of the app 
(2) to design an interface that will support the information needs associated with the tasks
(3) to design the interaction that will allow the user to complete these tasks

For each significant and non-trivial user task, briefly describe the activity. Keep this description general, focusing on the high-level goals rather than specific device/implementation/interaction methods.
