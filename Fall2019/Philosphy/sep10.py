- Argument types 
	- Deductive 
		Conclusion is true and cant be otherwise. i.e calculus 
		We do not reason beyond the available information. no Ideology 
	- Inductive 
		Probably true. men are more agressive than women, so any chosen random man will be agressive than any chosen random women from the set of Union of people
		Also consider what's known and not known 
		we can have good reasons to belive a conclusion but it still might not be true 

- Further in Deductive 
	- Validity 
		Entailment. if A Entails B then given A definatley B 
		**If a argument is valid, it can still be bad 
	- Soundness 
		good and reasonble 

How do we figure out if something is argument ?
	- is the stament trying to make us belive something ?
	- are there valid/sound reasons ?
	- and more ...

	- given example in class is valid but bad so not sound 

- Further in Inductive
	- Strong
