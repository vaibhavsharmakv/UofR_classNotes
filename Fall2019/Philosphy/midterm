For the analytic question 
- a statment which is true in the nature of virtue and predicate 
- all golden trumphets are golden is a analystic statement 
- all unmarried males are bachelor
	- either of these can work as a subject
	- predicate is contained within the subject itself 
Answer it with - here is an example - why it's a valid example

Question 12 
	fork is the desticntion between realtion of idea's and matter of facts and impression 
	- the things that we immediatly experience is an expression 
		- can be internal and external experience 
	All idea's require expression 
	example of internal expression - love and shit 

	all golden trumphets are golden does not tell us anything about the external world - the relation of idea's doesnt tell us anything about the world as golden trumphets does not tell us anything about trumphets 

	it shoulod be matter of fact that tell us something about the world 

	example - pepole sitting in front of me, how do we know that ? 
		- it's amatter of fact due to experience and impressions 
		- you cannot combine the two 
		- either you can answer with uncertinity or you dont get an answer at all 
		- one side of the fork is matter of fact and the other side of the fork is what we think/expressions/impressions
---------
	validity is on the assumtion that premises are true but does not garuntee the truth of the assumption / does not give conclusion 

	Soundness - are the premisses true 

	for induction - check validity 

----------
Question 3 

	how do you know we are not having a dream right now ?
	computer simulation and all ?
	how do we get beyond ourself ?

	for sense data -> we can either aquire them or produce them ourselves ex- dreaming 

	Ans - Sense data is in the mind - we can only expereince our mind - we dont have any grounds to say there is anything outside 


	We can expereince the lights are on - dont know if they are on as we not one with the lights - so therefore bla bla 

------------
Question 2 

	Dont need to tell the reader what conceptual analysis is as reader already knows that 
		- means We dont need to do x is coz y is this and all 

	we need to udnerstand what conceptual analysis is 
		- example ->  x is a bachelor if and only if unmarried male 
	- conceptual analysis is tryingt o figure out what is it we are trying to ficgure out. the example abhove will give us what is a bachelor 

	then we can have counter examples as a 2 year old is not a bachelor 


	Now traditional analysis -> conditons that conceputal analysis is true 

	someone is a bachelor if and only if unmarried male and an adult. the adult part here is providing the neccasary and sufficient conditions 


	Gettier style argument shows - shows that the example is unsuffienct 

	the example satisfies the gettier style arguments but doesnt show they have knowledge !!!!


	exmaple - Rusells clock , lottery case , 
------------
Question 7 - dont think so - but 9  might be there 

example what substance dualism is - same for question 9 - explain ontological argument 

explaine challenges to dualism - throw an example 


-------------
example - !!!

if i get hit in the head, will I able to think properly ? No 
thinking occurs in mind and you can go from there 

Mind body problem 

Fits in everything related to mind and dualism 

--------------
Question 8 
Turing test is not a Immitation game 
........
give example of immitation game, turing test and how it explains AI and all 

--------------
Watch the movie matrix and immiitation game 



--------------------------------------------
How to respond ?
lots of primary and seconday qualities regarding the question - start with the example - here is a thing which have the qualities the question is asking for 

Define what those things are and give an example 

9 - exaplain the terminologies in the question ,what is the main critisim for the ontological argument

10 - give the problem of evil- put it in premises and conclusion format to show it's a valid argument 

11 - memory theory vs other theory
