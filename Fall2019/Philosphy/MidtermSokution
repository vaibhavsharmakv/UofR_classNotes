Solution 1 
-> This is an inductive argument.Validity is the assumption that premises are true but does not garuntee the solution/conclusion. whereas, A sound argument is where the premises are a fact or truth.
 It's a valid argument because if we assume the premises are true then rising of sun will turn the moon to cheese but this is not a sound argument are premises are false. 

Solution 2
-> S knows that P (if and only if)
	- P is true (truth)
	- S belives that P is true (belief)
	- S is entilted to belive that P is true (justification)

	claim - Sam believs JT is prime minister of canada 
	- JT is prime minister of canada (truth)
	- S belives JT is prime minister of canada(belief)
	- S is entitled to believe that JT is prime minister of canada (Justification)

	Gettier- Style argument is truth belif and justification is enough for knowledge but we need more.
	An example would be john having 10 coins in his pocket means he will get the job. john got the job and had 10 coins in his pocket as well but it doesnt account to knowledge. 

Solution 3 
-> An external world skeptism is realizing what exists outside the realm of mind which is nothing. Sense data is experience or impressions that we can aquire or produce ourselves. an example is we don't know if we are dreaming right now ? or are the lights turned on ? they are only on because our mind is preciving them. We dont have any grounds to say there is anything outside the mind.

Solution 4
->
Primary Qualities: 
	Those qualities that cannot be taken away from an object—that are intrinsic to the object itself: solidity, extension, figure, mobility, and number.
	We can infer that there are insensible primary qualities on the bases of sensation organizing things into perceptual unity: The brain organizes the imperceptible primary qualities of an object by those objects causing the perception.
Secondary Qualities: 
	Those qualities that are not in the object themselves, but that the primary qualities produce in us: colors, sounds, tastes, etc.
	They are caused by the external object affecting our sense modalities.
	These qualities are in us only and not in the object. But they are cause in us by the object: warmth or blueness or sweetness is only the primary qualities of an object being produced in us.
	Consider the difference between the warmth of a fireplace and burning one’s hand in the fire. We don’t say the warmth or the pain is in the fire. 

Solution 5
{
		For the analytic question 
	- a statment which is true in the nature of virtue and predicate 
	- all golden trumphets are golden is a analystic statement 
	- all unmarried males are bachelor
		- either of these can work as a subject
		- predicate is contained within the subject itself 
	Answer it with - here is an example - why it's a valid example

}
-> The earth revolves around the sun. This statement is analytic because it is purely based on logical grounds and the truth is garunteed


Solution 8 
-> Its the game where 2 people hidden from the 3rd person answers the question asked to guess which one is male and female. In this, the female and have to lie and convince the third person to conclude that she is a male 

Turing test is where a AI machine and a human answers a thrid person where AI present it self as human and decieve the third person into thinking that he is not AI. 

If Ai is Able to decieve the human into thinking that he is human then its called intelligent/thining machine.
