- Interconnected network of router is -> Network Core
- Interconnected devices in a domain is -> Network edge

2 ways to send packets 
	- Packet switching = Router + switch (link layer)
		- Buffer -> storage for modem to store bits
	* Both end points need to be connected with the Core network to be able to communicate
	Routers use Routing table to figure out which router wil recove the buffer datta
	Routing tables = NAT ?
	- Circuit switching = 
		- We reserve the transmission rates for specific devcies to prevent packet loss
		- we cant loose packets
		- *Multiplexing
		- FDM vs TDM - look it up 
		-
** ISP connect and talk to each each called IXP (internet exchange point)
