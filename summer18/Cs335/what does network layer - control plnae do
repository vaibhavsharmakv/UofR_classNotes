Path -> the sequence of routers from the source to destination

	Good path  
		- low cost 
		- Fastest 
		- Low congestion

Graph -> a set of 2 or more nodes connected together with edge and a vertex represented as G = (V,E)
	- vertext -> the node
	- edge -> the distance 

Routing algorithms 
	- Global vs decentralized 
		- Link state alogrithms are global algortihms as they have infromations about all the other routers. It uses Djkistra
		- Decentralised algorithm is one where router only have information about it's neighboring routers.
	Static vs dynamic 
		- Numbers of router, path and cost to router does not change over time in static but in dynamic it changes with time

Djkistra Algorithm 
	N' = {u} // the initial node is u, N' is the set of 
				nodes in the graph
	
	/*
	All the neighboring nodes of u will get the distance 
	but the nodes which are not ajacent to u will be marked infinity

	*/
	for each node in N' except u  

		if V is adjacent to u 
			then D(v) = c(u,v)
		else 
			D(v) = 9999
	End for 

	While all nodes are not in N' do   // while   	      									 N'.size = N

		find w with minimum D(w) such that w is not in N'
			add w to N' 
			for each adjacent node to v to w such that v is not in N' do 
				update D(V) = min(D(v) + d(w) + c(w,v))
			End for 
	End while

	/*
	Complexity of the algorthm = O(N^2)

	*/

Routing protocols
 	- Problems
 		-  A router cannot store all destinations in the routing table 
 		- All routers in the worls don't run the same algorithms
 	- Solution -> Routing protocols
	 	 Problems can be fixed by Autonomous system in which each router have information about the other router in the same domain and each router runs the same algorithm

Intra - Autonomous system routing 
	- OSPF - Open shortest path first 
	- RIP - ROuting information protocol
	- IGRP - Interior gateway Routing protocol
	* these 3 are also knows as Interior Gateway Protocol

	OSPF -> 
		- Uses Djkistra algorithm 
		- also called minimum hop routing because the distance to each node is 1 which make its shortest path and least cost path same 
		- Security -> All messages are autheticated 
		- hierarchical -> Used in large domains

	BGP -> Border gateway Protocol
		- It holds all the routers together
	Two parts 
		- eBGP - external -
