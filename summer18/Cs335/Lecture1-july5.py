/------------------

- any device is a End system of a Network
- when we query from google.com
	- we are the client 
	- computer is our end systerm 
	- google is the host/server
- Calculating how many connections we need for (n) devcies ?
	- ((n^2)-(n)/2)
- we need protocols to follow how internet works
	- every equpment need to use the same language else we wont be able to interpret Network

Terminologies 
	- DSL -> digital subscriber line
	- Modulation -> sending low frequency signals over towers
		- we put our message in carrier and its sent via Network
	- HFC -> Hybrid fiber cable ? look it up
