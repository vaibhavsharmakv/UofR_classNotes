Defination :The Contrapositive of "P=>Q" is the statement "(~Q)=>(~P)"
example - If it rains I get an Umbrella 
Contrapositive : If I dont get an Umbrella it doesn not rain

Fact : P=>Q is equivalent to (~Q)=>(~P)
Can see they have same truth tables:
Table 1.2 in notebook 

==========================================
 - Modifiers()
 - Quantifiers()
    Examples:
    1. Everytime I open the window a bird enters
    2. Whenever I get hungry I get a muffin 
    3. For Every real number x, X^2 >= 0
    4.there is a real number such that X^2+ 2X +1 = 0
    
    Universal Quantifiers
    Every , for all, always , whenever  - all these are Quantifiers

    "Often" is a explicit Quantifier
    Example- x^2 > 0

    - Negating Statement envolving Quantifier
    P(x) means a statement in which the main subject is variable x
    FOR_EVERY x; P(X)
    
    Example - P(X) ="X^2+ 2X +1 = 0"
    THERE_IS an x for which P(x)

okay switching to Notebook
