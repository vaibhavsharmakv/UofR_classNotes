// Nothing in urcourses so far
just a bunch of definations 
- lemma
- theorem
- proposition

all three means that its already prooved

Algorithm- 
An explict procedure for solving a certain type of problem in finite # of steps

Statement Or proposition- 
A senetence that is  true or false

Proof -(of a result)
a Mathematical argument(series of logic of steps) that starts with some given assumption(Hypothesis) and ends with a desired conclusion

Axiom - A Mathematical fact or Mathematical assumption that is used without proof 

END of definations
-------------------------------------

Example of Statement Or proposition - 
- I like Icecream => this can be true or false so its a statement
- what time it is ? =? not a stament coz its true and cant be false
- 8+6 = 14 => can be true of false so its a statement
- 8+6 = 13 => can be true of false so its a statement
- find a chair? => cant be true or false so its not a statement



-Can we combine proposition?
    Yes, we can use Connective

Connective
- and, OR,NOT, Imply 

exaple  -

P = i like cofee 
Q = i like tea 

P AND Q are denoted by P^Q
P OR  Q are donated by PvQ
NOT P is donated by ~P 
P Implies Q is donated by P=>Q

Truth Tables

P  | ~P 
T  | F 
F  | T 

Possibilities of a truth table for P and Q
P|Q| PvQ | P^Q|NOR|NAND|
T|T| T   | T  | F | F  |
T|F| T   | F  | F | T  |
F|T| T   | F  | F | T  |
F|F| F   | F  | T | T  |
