            This is revealed when dumbledore states that " While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister"(Order of phoneix,__).

            This suggests dumbledore's' decision for leaving harry with the dursleys beacuse dumbledore knew that after the death of voldemort, the death eaters or his followers will go to any extend to hurt harry and living with his aunt petunia will give provide him his mother's' blood protection.

            - to make him humble , down to earth 
            - You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.”
            - this helped him to be a good person and whole hogwarts was with him in deathy hallows
            - the reason he survided Voldemort() attack in part 5 is coz he knew what it feel to have friends and loved

                All of this required him to have had a fairly normal childhood and education, which would have been impossible if he were tutored privately by Dumbledore.
                ///
                Dumbledore had his own cares and fears, of course. His fear was that Voldemort would try to act through Harry to harm him. His fear was for Harry, not for himself.
                ///
                Upbringing in Harry responsibility, morality, sacrifice based on love, kindness, modesty, etc. - one of Dumbledore's main goals. And he successfully coped with this'.

                “Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well — not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle’s doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and diffi- cult years.”(835)

                “Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.(837   `)
