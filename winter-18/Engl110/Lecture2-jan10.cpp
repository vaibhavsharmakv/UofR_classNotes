What is a hero?
=> (according to the prof)
- Hero cant be selfish and he have to helfull and all 
- 

The Hero's adventure'
=> there is a basic stereotype for all the stories that include hero
it include couple of stages
 stage 1 -  SEPERATION OR DEPERATION 
 here hero have to leave and go fight the bad guy 
 - hero is always resistant like nah i dont really wanna go fight 
 - supernatural aid -> so hero needs motivation and some help to leave and fight so this comes into play 
 - the crossing of first threshold - > here hero leave his scope and enters the bad world
 

 stage 2 -  TRIALS AND VICTORIES
 - The road of trials-> so now hero have to go through couple of task to shape himself which are helpfull at the end to defeat the bad guy 
 - Meeeting with goddness -> someone who tells them who they are and why are they so improtant 
 usually mother, god father
 - women as temptress -> prof so fast or i type slow

 stage 3 -  RETURN AND REINTERGRATION
 - Refusal of return -> Now hero wanna live here coz he defeated the bad guy and everyone likes him and also he is important here 
 - the magic fight - > he go back to his old world/home
 - again prof super fast 

======================
 why do elements appear sp much 
 => hero needs help and looking at harry he dont know shit so he always require help to  get thru anything 

 how does each author use these elements?
 => authors use these checklists to make sure in a story hero have all these so thats why they follow these basic pattern

 ==========================
characterstics of Heros
-Parents are really Important people , and they are usually dead
-childhood-> is sad, and they issually have a gurdian which is either too nice or evil 
example - batman vs harry potter
-Discover of destiny => hero discovers their identitiy, or get to know who they really are (so stereotypical)
example- harry potter was kept alive so he can killed at the end 

=================================
 Fatansy literature vs children literature
